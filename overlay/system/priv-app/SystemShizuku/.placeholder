# This directory is the Magisk overlay mount point for SystemShizuku.
#
# To make the module functional at runtime, place a pre-built
# SystemShizuku.apk here:
#
#   overlay/system/priv-app/SystemShizuku/SystemShizuku.apk
#
# The APK must be compiled from the upstream source:
#   https://github.com/zerofrip/system_shizuku
#
# Build requirements:
#   - AOSP source tree with Soong build system
#   - Platform signing key (the APK uses android:sharedUserId="android.uid.system")
#
# Without the APK, the overlay structure is verified but the service
# will not start.
